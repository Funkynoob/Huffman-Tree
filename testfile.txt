Four Words to Make Life Worth
while Over the years as I've sought out ideas, principles and strategies to life's challenges, I'v
e come across four simple words that can make living worthwhile. First, life is worthwhile if yo
u learn. What you don't know will hurt you. You have to have learning to exist, let alone succe
ed. Life is worthwhile if you learn from your own experiences -- negative or positive. We learn 
to do it right by first sometimes doing it wrong. We call that a positive negative. We also learn 
from other people's experience, both positive and negative. Second, life is worthwhile if you t
ry. You can't just learn; now you have to try something to see if you can do it. Try to make a diffe
rence, try to make some progress, try to learn a new skill, try to learn a new sport. It doesn't 
mean you can do everything, but there are a lot of things you can do, if you just try. Try your b
est and go all out. Third, life is worthwhile if you stay. You have to stay from spring until harve
st. Sometimes calamity comes and then it is worth wrapping it up. But just don't end in the mi
ddle. Maybe on the next project you pass, but on this one, if you signed up, see it through. An
d lastly, life is worthwhile if you care. If you care at all you will get some results, if you care en
ough you can get incredible results. Care enough to make a difference. Care enough to turn s
omebody around. Care enough to start a new enterprise. Care enough to set some records. C
are enough to win.
